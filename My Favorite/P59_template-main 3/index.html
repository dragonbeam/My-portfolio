        <p class="para">My favorite Hobby is Listening to Music. Believe it or not Music has a huge affect on emotions it can change a person mood so quickly that you wouldn't even notice. Your blood flows a lot more easily when Music is played, it also It elevates mood, It reduces stress, It relieves symptoms of depression, It stimulates memories, It manages pain and a lot more. While listening to music you can take your mind of something that maybe troubles you or even just to relax. Music is really powerful when it comes to your mood, emotions or even health problems sometimes music is used as a cure or stress reliever when it comes to mental illnesses.Music activates several different parts of the brain - there are complex messages to take in. Melody, pitch, rhythm, language, emotion, even memory and visualisation, all being received, or generated, in unison So no matter who you are or what tongue you speak, you're hearing the same language.
